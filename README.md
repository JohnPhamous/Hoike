Hoike turns your analog ukulele into a audio visualizer and learning tool. With LED strips attached to the neck and
body of the ukulele, you'll be able introduce a light show to your acoustic melodies.

### Visualization Mode

Hoike reads in the current audio with a microphone and will produce a hash that gets interpretted as a HEX value for the LED strip. This will ensure that each string/chord can produce a unique and repeatable color. Below are a few examples of the recorded audio spectrum:

#### G String

#### C Chord

### Training Mode

Hoike also teaches the user how to play the Ukulele. With pre-programmed songs, Hoike will walk the user through how to play different chords. The LEDs will light up under the fret where the user has to put their fingers.

## Complexities

### Completed Complexities:
* Hash function to map sound to red, blue, green, and brightness values
* USART between the atmega 1284 and Arduino Uno
* Used the LCD screen to act as a menu and provide user information
* Using EEPROM to store the position of learning mode. THis way the user doesn't have to skip forward to go back to where they left off.

### Incomplete Complexities:
* Addressing individual LEDs on the LED strip

## Known Bugs and Shortcomings
* Some LEDs in the fret board were blown while testing so many chord combinations cannot be shown
  * Can be fixed by using the correct resistors and rewiring
* LED strip sometimes does not turn off after switching from visualization mode to home 
  * Need to send zero'd values before switching from visualization mode to home mode over USART
* Microphone input has a lot of noise, even in a quiet room the lights still react
  * Read in a baseline value (most likely in amplitude) and only visualize the difference between the baseline and the current amplitude

## Future Work
* Making the wiring nicer and more compact so the Ukulele can be portable
* Adding a tuner, lights will be red if you're flat, blue if you're sharp, and green if you're in tune
